Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on 
HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.


HTTP1=>
*It works on the textual format.	
*There is head of line blocking 
that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.	
*It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	
*It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2=>
*It works on the binary protocol.
*It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
*It uses HPACK for data compression.
